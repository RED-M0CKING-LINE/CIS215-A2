In the SQL Queries folder I have the queries that I used to create the database structure. I'm pretty sure I included everything and that those commands should result in something very close to, if not exactly, to what I am using.

In the Pictures folder are screenshots, mostly of the application being used, but also one of the server's cockpit dashboard and one of the database though Azure Data Studio.

In the zip file is a clone of the git repo, which includes everything needed to run and build the project, recreate the database, etc. The actual repo is still private at the moment.
I don't expect you to go though all of that, but I included it for completeness. The README.md in that file may provide more insight into the project if you wish.
